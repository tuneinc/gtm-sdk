# TUNE Javascript SDK Tag Template
Tune offers a javascript library to support client-side tracking, [which is described in our documentation here](https://developers.tune.com/javascript-sdk/javascript-sdk/).

For users of Google Tag Manager, this template is offered as a convenience to set up client-side tracking without requiring any further snippets to be pasted into the website's code.
